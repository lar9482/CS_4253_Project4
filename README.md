# 4th project from CS 4253-01
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

Taught by [Dr. Sandip Sen](https://engineering.utulsa.edu/computer-science/faculty/profile/sandip-sen/) at the University of Tulsa in SP 23.

This repository implements two supervised learning models:
 - Decision Trees
 - Artificial Feedforward Neural Networks

The performance of these models were tested using the following datasets:
 - Artificial dataset. [[1]](https://github.com/lar9482/CS_4253_Project4/tree/master/Datasets/Artificial)
 - EMG Physical Action Dataset [[2]](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EMG+Physical+Action+Data+Set)
 - Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set [[3]](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/optical+recognition+of+handwritten+digits)
